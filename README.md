Build Instructions
--------------
These build instructions can also be found on the Open Meridian Project
[wiki](http://wiki.openmeridian.org/index.php/Detailed_Build_Instructions).

0. Install [Microsoft Visual Studio 2013](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx)
or greater.
0. Download this source code, either with a git client or with the
"Download ZIP" option from your chosen repository.

### Visual Studio GUI build
0. If you prefer the Visual Studio graphical interface, open
Meridian59.sln from the root folder of the codebase. Click on the
BUILD menu and select Build Solution (or press CTRL+SHIFT+B) to build.

### Makefile build
0. Locate your Visual Studio install folder, usually something like
`"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0"`.
Navigate to the Common folder, and then the Tools folder. Example:
`"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\Tools"`.
0. Create a shortcut (by right-clicking on vsvars32.bat and selecting
Create shortcut) called "Meridian Development Shell" on your desktop
or in your start menu with the following property:
Target: `%windir%\system32\cmd.exe /k "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft
Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat"`
0. OPTIONAL: set the "Start In" property of your shortcut to the folder
that contains the meridian source code for ease of use.
0. Open the Meridian Development Shell and navigate to the folder
containing the source code, then enter `nmake debug=1` to compile.

Getting Started: Server
--------------
0. After compilation completes, browse to the `.\run\server folder`,
and double click `blakserv.exe` to start the server.
0. Go to the `Administration` tab on the server's interface and enter
the command: `create account admin username password` (with your
desired username and password). You will see a message saying `Created
ACCOUNT 4` or similar.
0. Then create a character slot on that account with `create admin 4`,
using whichever number the previous line returned instead of 4.
0. You'll now be able to log in with this account name and password.
Be sure to "save game" from the server interface to save this new
account.

Getting Started: Client
--------------
You will need to obtain the client graphics before you can run the
client locally. To do this, [download the patcher](http://openmeridian.org/patcher)
and use that program to download a copy of the 105 client.
When this is installed, building the client (via makefile or VS
solution) will automatically copy the needed resources to the
appropriate directory. If for some reason this isn't done, copy
the files manually from the 105 client's resource directory to
your repo's .\run\localclient\resource directory. Running postbuild.bat
from the root directory of the repo will also perform the copy function.
Resources may differ between versions of Meridian 59; if using the
[server 103 source](https://www.github.com/OpenMeridian/Meridian59)
make sure to the 103 client has been downloaded in the patcher.

0. After compilation completes, the client is located at
`.\run\localclient`.
0. You can point your local client at your local server by running the
client `meridian.exe` with command line flags, like this:
`meridian.exe /U:username /W:password /H:localhost /P:5959`.
0. Building the client will generate a shortcut to `meridian.exe`,
with these flags, however if this shortcut isn't present in your
client directory, you can create it by making the shortcut,
right-clicking it and selecting Properties, and adding
`/H:localhost /P:5959` after the existing link in the `Target:` box.

Note that any time you recompile KOD code, changes need to be loaded
into your local blakserv server by clicking the 'reload system' arrow
icon, next to the 'save game' disk icon.

Third-Party Code
--------------
Meridian uses zlib and libarchive.  zlib was installed from binaries.
libarchive was built from source, with the following cmake environment
variables set to use zlib:

* `ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR` points to the include directory
* `ZLIB_LIBRARY` points to lib/zdll.lib
