      "major update to the game and included the titular area, the Vale of "
      "Sorrows (the fey forest) and the new monsters, fey elhai and fey "
      "dirhai.  This update also contained the new Assassin's Game, and the "

      "with a variety of new monsters, lore, the magic school of Riija and new "
      "art for players and several mobs.  The Justicar system was also added "
      "in this update.  The changes to player art replaced the ones that had "
      "been in the game since beta (including the removal of the iconic gold "
      "plate) and are still in use today.  The city of Tos was revamped in "
      "Revelation, and the Streets of Tos we have today was added at this "

      "scenario.  This much loved scenario added two items - the Sword of the "
      "Hunt and the Amulet of Three - which were limited in number (30 of "
      "each) and allowed players to join a PvP game involving a boss monster "
      "(the Lich, Queen Venya'cyr).  The items offered large stat and building "
      "bonuses, and if the the Lich was ever killed all the Ao3 holders would "

      "faction led by Jonas and added new art for the cities of Barloque and "
      "Jasper.  The old duke, Kalior, was killed and replaced by his nephew "
      "Akardius complete with an intricate lore-based quest for the players "

      "The second part of the three-part update was released in January 1999."
      "This update added private rooms for players in Marion and Barloque, the "
      "shrines which can be dedicated to schools for spellpower boosts, and "
      "the xeo'chicatl node attacks.  The city of Marion also received a "
      "graphics update in Dark Auspices. Unfortunately due to the issues at 3DO "
      "the third part of the update was never completed. This was to include "
      "an attack from Miriana destroying Cor Noth, the introduction of dark "
      "angels in node attacks and the ability for players to teach each other "
      "spells.  A smaller update, Liberation, was released in July 1999 with "
      "bug fixes and infrastructure improvements and was the last update from "
      "3DO."

      "Resurrection was the first version of Meridian 59 released by Near "
      "Death Studios (NDS) on June 13, 2002.  This update removed the "
      "Necromancer scenario and the SotH/Ao3 items due to the number of bugs.  "
      "Many spell changes were made for the re-release of the game - notably "
      "Purify's negative effects were split into a new spell (Purge) and much "
      "of the school of Jala was added.  Shortly after the initial update, "

      "the game since its release - the DirectX 3D rendering engine in the "
      "client, bringing Meridian 59's graphics more in line with other games."
      "Evolution also saw the addition of the thrashers and the Marion crypt "
      "expansion.  This was the last major update from NDS, and the servers "
      "and rights to the game were returned to the original technical "
      "developers Andrew and Christopher Kirmse (Zaphod and Zandramas) in "
